# The-usage-of-RPLidar-A2M12-with-Raspberry-Pi
I ran the RPLidar A2M12 using Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. I did this on the Debian Bullseye operating system of Raspberry Pi. While some RPLidar projects use systems like ROS, the reason I used simple grabber is because ROS is not compatible with Debian Bullseye. I connected the RPLidar to the Raspberry Pi via USB.
